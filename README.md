# VR-STAND

What This Project Is



This is the CAD design for the stand that I created for holding the VR headset. This design consists of a broad base and two angled arms that support a curved rest.


How it Helps Me

- This protects my equipment and keeps my VR headset away from the surface of the desk and helps to ensure that the lenses and straps are not scratched.

- This keeps the surroundings clean as it offers a dedicated, clean place to store the headset when I am not using it.

- Besides that, it also looks aesthetically good if you are going to use it as a stand and it gives your desk a good look


How Others Can Use It

- Anyone can 3D print the stand for their own use
- The user can easily adjust the size of the base and the shape of the curve for the cradle inside the CAD file to accommodate various types of VR headsets and controllers.
