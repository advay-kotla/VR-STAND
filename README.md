# VR-STAND

What This Project Is

   This is the CAD model for a stand that I designed which was built to hold a VR headset. It uses a wide, stable base and two angled arms with a curved cradle at the top.

How It Helps Me

   It protects my gear and keeps my VR headset off the desk and prevents the lenses or straps from being scratched or damaged.

   It also keeps things tidy as it provides a specific, clean spot for storing the headset when I'm not using it.

   As well as that it also looks aesthetic if you have a stand and it gives your desk a good look

How Others Can Use It

   Anyone can 3D print the stand for their own use at home.

   Users can easily adjust the size of the base or the curve of the cradle in the CAD file to fit different types of VR headsets or controllers.
