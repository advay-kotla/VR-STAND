// 1 - Created the Base

I sketched a large circle and extruded it to create the solid, flat foundation for the stand. I immediately rounded the top edge of the base with a Fillet tool to give it a finished, smooth look and ensure stability on a desk.

// 2 - Building the Main Support Arms

I created the shape for the two main upright pieces. I started with tall rectangular blocks, then cut off the bottom corners at an angle so they would lean back slightly. This angling is important for making the stand sturdy and look aggressive.

// 3 - Attaching Supports to Base

I positioned the two angled support arms onto the base and made sure they were spaced correctly for the VR headset to fit. I used a Cut tool on the base to remove material between the arms, which saves weight and adds a design element.

// 4 - Adding the Connecting Bridge and Cradle

I added the horizontal block that connects the two support arms near the top. This bridge holds the arms steady. I then shaped the two 'cradles' (the curved pieces on the top edge) that will actually hold the VR headset band. I made sure the curve matched what I needed for the headset.

// 5 - Final Smoothing and Detailing

For the final hour, I went over the entire model and smoothed out almost every sharp corner using the Fillet tool. This was applied to the angled supports, the connecting bridge, and the edges of the base to make the final product safe and professional-looking.
